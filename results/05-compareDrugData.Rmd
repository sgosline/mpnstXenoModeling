```

## Load all data from Synapse

Let's load all the data using the `MXM` package function. This will pull the data from synapse and format it accordingly.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MXM)
#this function simply loads all the data into memory
MXM::loadPDXData()

##let's clean up drug Dat
head(drugData)
#all.pdxs<<-MXM::formatDataToXeva()

```

## Load microtissue data and compare
The first thing we want to do is to load the microtissue data and carry out the bayesian correction. This is prety straightforward.

```{r correction, warning=FALSE}

```
