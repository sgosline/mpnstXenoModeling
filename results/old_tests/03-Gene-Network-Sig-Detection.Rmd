## Get networks and format
For each sample we've computed a mutational network and the distance of each network to the community. 


```{r getNetworkMapping, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tab<-querySynapseTable('syn22279826')

loadPDXData() # loads all the data


```

## Reshape the data and join with metadata

We also have clinical data associated with the samples

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
